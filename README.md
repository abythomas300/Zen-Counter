🌸 Zen-Counter - The Art of Button-Driven Minimalism 🧘‍♂️
Welcome to Zen-Counter, the ultimate exercise in simplicity and mindfulness for the modern web user. Forget about overwhelming designs or flashy animations—this is counter enlightenment at its finest.

What It Offers:
🌀 Decrease: Embrace life's ebb.
💫 Increase: Celebrate life's flow.
🔄 Reset: Achieve a state of counter Nirvana.

Why Zen-Counter Stands Out:

Minimalistic by intention, not by accident (we swear).
Helps you connect with your inner peace, one click at a time.
No distractions—just numbers, buttons, and your thoughts.
Warning: This repository is so calming, it might make you forget CSS even exists.

⭐ Star it, fork it, or just meditate on its simplicity. Namaste. 🙏
